# 2022 Portfolio
Created a cleaner portfolio to display my skills (took inspiration from Andrew Borstein's portfolio as seen in Medium article)

## Technologies
- React 17+ (create-react-app)
- Material UI v5.4.4 
  - @emotion theming and styled components (as opposed to makeStyles)
  - @mui/material core library
  - @mui/icons-material has many more icons than before

## Features
- Responsive content (navbar and cards)

## Development Features
- PropTypes checking on components
- Custom Theming with constants in theme.js
- Styled components written with @emotion (built-in styling from Material UI)

## Implementation
- npx create-react-app
- created all components to be used (ResponsiveDrawer (Sidebar + Appbar), Landing, About, Experience, Projects, Skills, Education, Contact)
- loaded custom theme from theme.js in utils
- created custom theming using [https://material.io/inline-tools/color/](https://material.io/inline-tools/color/)
- created background CSS using site and Hex to RGB Color Converter [https://www.magicpattern.design/tools/css-backgrounds](https://www.magicpattern.design/tools/css-backgrounds)

#### Bug Fixes
- CSS opacity only applies on images. When applying opacity to background image, use an overlay with backgroundColor rgba.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
